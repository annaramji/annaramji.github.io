## Hello!

Welcome to my website! My name is Anna Ramji and I'm a recent graduate from the Master of Environmental Data Science ([MEDS](https://bren.ucsb.edu/masters-programs/master-environmental-data-science)) program at the Bren School of Environmental Science & Management at UC Santa Barbara. I'm currently working as an Ocean Health Index ([OHI](https://oceanhealthindex.org/)) fellow at the National Center of Ecological Analysis and Synthesis ([NCEAS](https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/)).

I'm interested in all things sustainability, including (but definitely not limited to):

-   developing the renewable energy grid

-   carbon accounting and corporate sustainability

-   ocean health and resource management

-   agroecology
