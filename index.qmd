## Hello!

Welcome to my website! My name is Anna Ramji and I'm an environmental data scientist. 


My current role is as a Data Analyst at [Gridware](https://www.gridware.io) in the SF Bay Area. 
I recently worked as an Ocean Health Index ([OHI](https://oceanhealthindex.org/)) fellow at the National Center of Ecological Analysis and Synthesis ([NCEAS](https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/)). 

I graduated from the Master of Environmental Data Science ([MEDS](https://bren.ucsb.edu/masters-programs/master-environmental-data-science)) program at the Bren School of Environmental Science & Management at UC Santa Barbara in 2024. I also have a B.S. in Environmental Sciences from UC Berkeley (go bears!).

I'm interested in all things sustainability, including (but definitely not limited to):

-   developing the renewable energy grid

-   ocean health and resource management

-   agroecology and sustainable agriculture

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Education:

**Master of Environmental Data Science (MEDS)**, Bren School of Environmental Science & Management, University of California, Santa Barbara (2024). Academic Achievement Award (sole recipient). 

**B.S. Environmental Sciences** (Honors), University of California, Berkeley (2021)
