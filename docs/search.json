    "text": "CA Spiny Lobsters\n\n\nImage credits: By Ed Bierman from CA, USA - Spiny Lobster, CC BY 2.0, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=61489279\n\n\nIn this project, I work with data from the Santa Barbara Coast LTER sites, analyzing data using statistical analysis methods covered in the Master of Environmental Data Science program’s Environmental Data Science (EDS) 222: Statistics for Environmental Data Science course taught by Tamma Carleton.\nI first became interested in lobsters in 2021 during the pandemic, when I, and millions of other lobster laypeople came across a now TikTok- and YouTube-famous Maine Lobster fisherman’s videos. In these clips, Jacob Knowles, the current lead of a multi-generational, family-owned lobster fishing operation, candidly portrays what it’s like to be a lobster fisherman in Maine during lobster season. This is a gross generalization, and there are many nuances, including casually disseminated lobster facts and information, special close-ups on rare lobsters (sometimes blue, recently a 1-in-50 million chance half-blue-half-red lobster named Bowie.\nI later learned that Maine Lobster fisheries are threatened by climate change, with rising sea temperatures and environmental pressures pushing American Lobster (Homarus americanus) populations farther north or into general decline if not managed appropriately 1, 2, 3. Intense warming in waters on the East Coast coupled with failure to act and adapt quickly enough has already led to the collapse of the Gulf of Maine cod fishery 4.\nLobsters are sensitive to change, and it can impact their behavior5. Recent studies suggests that changing sea temperatures have implications on the size at which Homarus americanus reach maturity, and bacterial diversity and cultivability 6, 7. Warming that impacts areas that juvenile lobsters rely on can lead them to become inhospitable, which is particularly dangerous as the Gulf of Maine has been warming at a rate faster than 99% of the world’s oceans 8, 9.\nGiven all of this established background and concern over the American Lobsters, as a Santa Barbara resident and lifelong fan of the California coast and all of its marine life, I wondered if the California Spiny Lobster Panulirus interruptus, was facing similar threats.\n\nImage credits: Brett Seymour for NPS\nThe species is currently listed as a species of “least concern” on the IUCN Redlist, and their populations have been managed by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife for decades. If you aren’t already convinced, I’m happy to inform you that the CA Spiny Lobster is significant both economically and ecologically. In the 2017-2018 fishing season, the commercial fishery accounted for roughly $12.7 million in ex-vessel value, and the recreational fishery contributes “between $33-40 million in consumer spending to the California economy each year.” 10\nDo you think kelp forests are cool? Well, these lobsters are also a keystone species in California’s kelp forest ecosystems. They’re a key predator of purple sea urchins, which love to eat the Giant Kelp that the rest of the ecosystem depends on. Spiny lobsters relieve this predation (urchin grazing) on Giant Kelp forests and as many larger fish prey on these lobsters, they are a key, mid-trophic level species11. They typically forage at night, and according to the CADFW’s Marine Species Portal, “the Spiny lobster provides an important role in the ecology of rocky reefs, and it is associated with critical habitats such as surfgrass beds.” 12\nThe Santa Barbara Coast and the Channel Islands National Park are key areas of the California Spiny Lobsters’ habitat:\n\nThe presence of eelgrass or surfgrass in the rocky reefs in these areas also provide critical habitat for the 11 larval stages of Spiny lobsters.\nPanulirus interruptus are estimated to reach sexual maturity at around 5-7 years old (Females typically take longer to mature) which is estimated by a carapace length of 2.5 inches, or 63.5 millimeters 13. The CA Department of Fish & Wildlife manages the Spiny Lobster populations in part by restricting the months during which it is legal to hunt/fish for them. The fishing season is from early October to mid-March, which allows populations to recover in the off-season, as this species has a complex reproductive cycle and needs to molt (shed their exoskeleton) which makes them especially vulnerable to predation. The legal catch size is 3.25 inches, or 82.55 millimeters 14. Overall, it seems that the populations are able to remain stable thanks to the careful management of the CADFW.\n\nThis diagram labels key attributes of the California Spiny Lobster, including the area that is measured to obtain the carapace length (CL) measurements used in determining maturity, catch length, and as a proxy for age.\nI also became interested in investigating how the 2015/2016 El Niño may have impacted Spiny lobster populations, as it was the most extreme El Niño in the previous 145 years15. With the warmer sea surface temperatures associated with El Niño events, would we see populations being impacted on the Santa Barbara Coast?\n\n\nThe Santa Barbara Coastal Long Term Ecological Research project (SBC LTER) has many study sites at which a wide variety of data are collected, from fish abundance and population dynamics to complex water chemistry and temperature data. Using this data and the context given above, I tried to answer the question: What is the relationship between California Spiny Lobster populations and reef bottom temperatures?\nTo investigate the relationship between CA Spiny Lobsters populations and reef bottom temperatures, I used carapace length as it is the primary size metric for lobsters and is used as a proxy measurement for age, which can help provide information about the population structure at various reef sites. I also used reef bottom temperatures (as apposed to sea surface temperatures (SST). All of this data was collected at reef study sites in the SBC LTER network.\nThe five SBC LTER Reef sites that I’ll be using data from in this analysis are:\n\nArroyo Quemado Reef: site code “AQUE”\n\ndepth range: 5.4 meters to 10.7 meters\n\nNaples Reef: site code “NAPL”\n\ndepth range: 5.9 m to 13.4 m\n\nIsla Vista Reef: site code “IVEE”:\n\ndepth range: 8.2 m to 8.8 m\n\nMohawk Reef: site code “MOHK”:\n\ndepth range: 4.5 m to 6.0 m\n\nCarpinteria Reef: site code “CARP”:\n\ndepth range: -2.2 m to -8.8 m\n\n\nI’ve labeled these on a screenshot of a geographically contextual rendered map preview from the SBC LTER wesite:\n\nTwo of these sites, Naples (NAPL) and Isla Vista (IVEE), indicated with a black line connecting them, are in Marine Protected Areas (MPAs).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis dataset contains records on the abundance, size, and fishing effort on the California Spiny Lobster, Panulirus interruptus, at five SBC LTER study sites, with records from August 2012 to August 2023.\nWhile most data was collected in the month of August at the selected study sites, there is a discrepancy that is very relevant to our analysis. - In 2014, the Arroyo Quemado Reef (site code AQUE) only had data collected in September (56 observations), and the Isla Vista Reef site (site code IVEE) had 6 carapace length observations collected in September and 114 in August of that same year.\nThis is relevant to our analysis because both carapace length and ocean temperatures are related to the time of year – as more time passes, lobsters grow in size, and water temperatures fluctuate seasonally, as shown in this data visualization of monthly mean temperatures from Shore Stations (one of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography’s programs that works to collect daily temperature (SST) and salinity records at sites along the California coast from La Jolla to Trinidad).\n\n\n\n5 year monthly mean SSTs vs long-term averages\n\n\nNotes on methods, limitations: “Transects were sampled by two SCUBA divers during daylight hours” – this is notable because lobsters are most active at night, which may add further limitations on the ability of the sample of the population, so any conclusions we come to based on our analysis of these data may not have as much significance or strength in our ability to make claims about the true population.\nData Citation:\nReed, D. & Miller, R.

Having only\nDue to the nature of lobster carapace size increasing over time (positive age-size relationship), if we include the 2014 September data for AQUE, we could get a falsely high “baseline” carapace size for that study site before the El Niño event, which could skew our results. An additional concern I have is about how our average Reef bottom temperature data will interact in all of this. Sea surface temperatures fluctuate over time and both seasonal variation and wind levels can impact ocean temperatures on the California Coast 16,17.\nAnother issue that comes up with excluding 2014 data for the AQUE study site is that in all other sites, the average carapace size (mm) was greater in 2014 than in 2013. This could mean that by excluding 2014 data for the AQUE study site, in our attempt to avoid a falsely high baseline/comparison point, we are obtaining a falsely low one. If we include both months of 2014 data, the IVEE study site is also skewed to have higher average carapace sizes for that year, as I’ll show later.\nTo address this discrepancy in the data, In my analysis, I will make two subsets: one in which we keep all of our data (denoted in our outputs as August data and August & September data), and the other will only include data collected in August. We can compare the results of our statistical analyses as we go.\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst, we’ll make two subsets (August vs. August & September) and then we’ll plot the average carapace lengths over time, grouped by site,\n\n\nCode\n# making a tidied subset, finding average count and size per year per site\n\n# keeping data from August and September\nlobster_all &lt;- lobster_size %&gt;% \n  group_by(year, site) %&gt;% \n  summarize(avg_size = mean(size_mm, na.rm = TRUE),\n            max_size = max(size_mm, na.rm = TRUE), \n            min_size = min(size_mm, na.rm = TRUE))\n\n# keeping August data only\nlobster_august &lt;- lobster_size %&gt;%  \n  filter(month(date) == 8) %&gt;% \n  group_by(year, site) %&gt;% \n  summarize(avg_size = mean(size_mm, na.rm = TRUE),\n            max_size = max(size_mm, na.rm = TRUE), \n            min_size = min(size_mm, na.rm = TRUE))\n\n\n\nAugust & SeptemberAugust\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# plot average lobster size per site per year, including September data\nlobster_size_plot_all &lt;- lobster_all %&gt;%  ggplot() + \n  geom_point(aes(x = year, y = avg_size,\n                 color = site)) +\n  geom_line(aes(x = year, y = avg_size,\n                 color = site)) +\n  # carapace length at sexual maturity \n  geom_hline(yintercept = 63.5,\n             linetype = \"dashed\",\n             alpha = 0.6) + \n  # catch length\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 82.55,\n             linetype = \"dashed\",\n             alpha = 0.6) + \n  # 2015 El Niño\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 2015,\n             linetype = \"dotted\") + \n  facet_wrap(~site) +\n  theme_bw() +\n  theme(strip.background = element_rect(fill = \"transparent\")) +\n  labs(\n    #color = \"Site\",\n       x = \"Year\",\n       y = \"Average Carapace Length (mm)\",\n       title = \"Annual average Spiny Lobster carapace length (2012-2023)\",\n       subtitle = \"organized by SBC LTER study site\") +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\")\n\n\nlobster_size_plot_all\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# plot average lobster size per site per year\nlobster_size_plot_august &lt;- lobster_august %&gt;%  ggplot() + \n  geom_point(aes(x = year, y = avg_size,\n                 color = site)) +\n  geom_line(aes(x = year, y = avg_size,\n                 color = site)) +\n  # showing lobster size of sexual maturity \n  geom_hline(yintercept = 63.5, linetype = \"dashed\", color = \"dimgrey\", alpha = 0.5) + \n  geom_hline(yintercept = 82.55, linetype = \"dashed\", alpha = 0.5) + \n  geom_vline(xintercept = 2015,  linetype = \"dotted\") + # showing 2015 El Niño\n  facet_wrap(~site) +\n  theme_bw() +\n  theme(strip.background = element_rect(fill = \"transparent\")) +\n  labs(\n    #color = \"Site\",\n       x = \"Year\",\n       y = \"Average Carapace Length (mm)\",\n       title = \"Annual average Spiny Lobster carapace length (2012-2023)\",\n       subtitle = \"organized by SBC LTER study site, data collected in August only\") +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\")\n\nlobster_size_plot_august\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe vertical dotted line indicates the first year of the 2015-2016 El Niño\nThe lower dashed horizontal line indicates the average estimated size (and corresponding age) at which the California Spiny Lobster reaches sexual maturity: around 2.5 inches (63.5 mm), or 58mm and 5 years old for Males and 70 mm and roughly 7 years old for Females 18, 19.\nThe higher dashed horizontal line indicates the minimum legal catch size: a carapace measuring 3.25 inches or 82.55 mm, or around 8-13 years old (estimated age range of 7-11 for Males, 8-13 for Females) 20.\n\n\n\n\nNote the significant difference in slopes between year 2014 and 2015 data points for average carapace size (mm) at the AQUE study site between the September-inclusive and September-exclusive (August only) plots. There is also a subtle change at the IVEE study site between 2014 and 2015 between the two plots as well, supporting what we know about how carapace lengths increase over time, even on a monthly level.\n\nTaking the average size (carapace length) per site per year shows potentially interesting trends. At all sites, there is a notable drop in average carapace length (mm) from 2014 to 2015, both including and excluding September 2014 data. This significant change in slope of the lines connecting data points for average carapace length coincides with the 2015/2016 El Niño, which was the strongest over a 145 year record 21. During El Niño events, sea surface temperatures (SST) rise, and SST estimates can also serve as an indicator for coastal ocean temperature levels – if SST is rising, the temperatures at the bottom of relatively shallow, coastal reef sites are likely rising as well. In some cases, depending on the thermocline (inverted or not) that a reef experiences, Sea Bottom Temperatures (SBT) can even be higher than SST 22.\nThese visualizations suggests that the Santa Barbara Coast LTER sites are somewhat of a haven for California Spiny lobsters in their first few of years of breeding, as stated on the CADFW info page on the California Spiny lobster. As this graph shows an average carapace size, and lobsters can vary significantly in size depending on their age, these research sites are likely home to a wide age and developmental stage range of lobsters.\nLet’s move on to incorporate the other essential data in investigating the relationship between reef bottom temperatures and average lobster size (carapace length, mm), – Reef bottom temperature!\n\n\n\n\nOur reef bottom temperature data is pretty huge – temperatures were recorded every 15 minutes at multiple SBC LTER study sites since 2002.\nRegarding our previous dilemma of “to include or not to include” September carapace length data, we now have an opportunity to decide how we want to aggregate our reef bottom temperature data. I could filter it by month, keeping temperature records only from the month of August, or I could include September as well. I could also have another different subset, which incorporates temperature data from August and September only at sites IVEE and AQUE for 2014, and filter it to only keep August dates for all other sites that year and all sites at all years. This can get pretty complicated pretty quickly, as the easiest inclusive option – filtering just for August and September – has the drawback of interfering with the estimated relationship between average carapace length and water temperature for the majority of our data.\nIn my analysis, I’ve decided to only select reef bottom temperature records in the month of August, which I then average and join with the lobster data by year and by site.\nFirst, we’ll plot the average August reef bottom temperature per year across all sites, noting the spike in temperature in the first year of the 2015/2016 El Niño. This dataset ranges from 2002 to 2023, but the last month of the record is July, so we’ll have August data spanning from 2002-2023 before we join it with our lobster data set. Then, we’ll plot the average August temperatures over time by site, comparing with the average size by site plot created earlier.\n\n\nCode\n# prepping water temp data to compare with lobster data\n\n# finding average August reef bottom temperatures across all sites over \n# the full time range of our water dataset (2002-2022)\nallsites_aug_temps &lt;- water_data %&gt;% \n  filter(month %in% c(8)) |&gt; # select August temps\n  filter(site %in% c((unique(lobster_size$site)))) %&gt;% # selecting Lobster data study sites\n  group_by(year) %&gt;%  \n  summarize(avg_temp = mean(temp_c, na.rm = TRUE)) # find avg temp\n\n\naugust_temps &lt;- water_data %&gt;%\n  filter(site %in% c((unique(lobster_size$site)))) %&gt;% \n  filter(month == 8)\n\nmean_aug_temp &lt;- mean(august_temps$temp_c)\n\nprint(paste0(\"The average August reef bottom temperature across the 5 reef study sites from 2002-2022 is \", round(mean_aug_temp, 2), \"ºC.\"))\n\n\n[1] \"The average August reef bottom temperature across the 5 reef study sites from 2002-2022 is 16.19ºC.\"\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# making a subset to show selected year range\nallsites_aug_temp_plot &lt;- ggplot(data = allsites_aug_temps) +\n  geom_point(aes(x = year, \n                 y = avg_temp)) +\n  geom_line(aes(x = year, \n                y = avg_temp)) +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 2015,  linetype = \"dotted\") + # showing 2015 El Niño \n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = (seq(2000,2022, by = 5)), \n                     minor_breaks = seq(2002, 2022, by = 1)) +\n  theme_bw() +\n  labs(title = \"Average Reef Bottom Temperatures in August Over Time\",\n       subtitle = \"across selected SBC LTER study sites (2002-2022)\", \n       x = \"Year\",\n       y = \"Average Temperature (ºC)\") +\n  annotate(\"text\", x=2014, y=19, label=\"El Niño\", angle=0) \n\n\nallsites_aug_temp_plot\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is a clear spike in average reef bottom temperature in August of 2015 across all study sites, and a significant dip in 2010. There is also a notable spike (and maximum peak) at all sites in 2018. There were record-breaking SST anomalies in 2018 at many points along the Southern California Coastline, particularly along La Jolla, San Diego, where the Scripps Institution of Oceanography recorded water temperatures of 25.9 degrees Celsius, beating the previous record of 25.8 C from 1931 23, 24.\nNow we’ll join the lobster size data and the temperature data, which will narrow our time range to 2012-2022.\n\n\nCode\n# making august-only water temp subset\naugust_site_temps &lt;- water_data %&gt;%  \n  filter(month(date) %in% c(8)) %&gt;%  # select August temps\n  filter(site %in% c((unique(lobster_size$site)))) %&gt;%  # selecting Lobster data study sites\n  group_by(year, site) %&gt;%  # grouping by year and site to join (only 1 month, no need to group by it)\n  summarize(avg_temp = mean(temp_c, na.rm = TRUE)) # find avg temp\n\n\nlobster_temps_august &lt;- inner_join(lobster_august, august_site_temps) %&gt;% \n  select(-max_size, -min_size)\n\n\n# this will make sure that we're comparing the same month for each site and each year, \n# so for most years, sites, and months, it'll be august data\n# but for the 2014 AQUE and IVEE data collected in September,\n\nsite_temps &lt;- water_data %&gt;%  \n  filter(month(date) %in% c(8, 9)) %&gt;%  # select August and September temps\n  filter(site %in% c((unique(lobster_size$site)))) %&gt;%   # selecting Lobster data study sites\n  group_by(year, month, site) %&gt;%  # grouping by year, month, and site, so we can join by all \n  summarize(avg_temp = mean(temp_c, na.rm = TRUE)) # find avg temp\n\n# we'll be pairing those averages with average temperature in September\nlobster_temps_all &lt;- inner_join(site_temps,\n                                lobster_all) %&gt;%  # this df also has maintained its \"month\" column\n  select(-max_size, -min_size)\n\n\n\nAvg.

The dashed horizontal lines in the temperature plots show the 20-year average August reef bottom temperature (from 2002-2022). The dashed horizontal lines in the average size plot show the carapace lengths at sexual maturity (lower) and catch size (higher).\nComparing our average temperature and average size plots side by side, there seems to be visual evidence for some trends or relationship between average temperature and average carapace length. At all sites, in 2015 when the average August temperature spikes, average carapace lengths decrease. At the Naples reef site, after the temperature spikes in 2018 and falls dramatically in 2019, we see a spike in average carapace length in 2019. As average August reef bottom temperatures continue to fall in 2020 in Naples, lower than the average temperature over the previous 8 years, the average carapace size seems to drop slightly at that site. The most extreme drops in average carapace length at sites Arroyo Quemado, Carpinteria, and Mohawk happen when the temperature spikes in 2015. When temperatures fall back down closer to the 20-year average August reef bottom temperature in 2016, the Arroyo Quemado reef site is the only site where average carapace lengths seem to recover within that annual cycle. Unfortunately, we are missing temperature data at the Mohawk reef site in 2017. Overall, there seem to be complexities in the population structures at all sites, with similar overall trends in average August reef bottom temperature.\n\n\n\n\nIn this section, we will:\n\n\nlook at the general relationship between our size and temperature variables (plot)\nrun multiple linear regression (size ~ temp + site)\nrun multiple regression with an interaction term (size ~ temp + site + temp:site)\nrun simple linear regression (size ~ temp) for each site\n\n\n\nBefore we dive into the complexities of the relationship between average carapace length in August and average reef bottom temperature in August, let’s take a more general look at the combined data that we’re working with.\nHere we’ll plot our joined size & temperature data subset with data exclusively collected in August each year from 2012-2022:\n\n\nCode\n# preliminary plot of the joined data\nlobster_temps_august_plot &lt;- ggplot(data = lobster_temps_august, \n                             aes(x = avg_temp,\n                                 y = avg_size)) + \n  geom_jitter(alpha = 0.7) +\n  geom_smooth(method='lm',\n              formula= y~x,\n              na.rm = TRUE,\n              color=\"seagreen\",\n              se=TRUE) +\n  scale_x_continuous(expand = c(0,0), limits = c(14.5, 20)) +\n  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0,0), limits = c(65, 94)) + \n  theme_bw() +\n  ggpubr::stat_regline_equation(\n    aes(label = after_stat(eq.label))) + \n  labs(title = \"Average Lobster Size by Average Reef Bottom Temperature (August, annual averages)\", \n       subtitle = \"SBC LTER data on California Spiny Lobster carapace length (mm), reef bottom temperatures (ºC)\", \n       x = \"Average Temperature (ºC)\",\n       y = \"Average Size (mm)\")\n\n# view plots\nlobster_temps_august_plot\n\n\n\n\n\nThere seems to be a relationship here, where as average reef bottom temperatures increase, average lobster carapace lengths decrease, though with relatively few data points here and the impact that site may have on this relationship not accounted for in this plot, it is hard to make any real claims.\n\n\n\nWith our current data, we can model the relationship between average carapace length (mm) in August with the following multiple regression equation:\n\\[\\mu CL_i =\\beta_{0}+\\beta_{1} \\mu Temp_i +\\beta_{2} \\text Site+\\varepsilon_i\\] Where\n\n\\(\\mu CL\\) is the average carapace length, in millimeters, in August\n\\(\\beta_{0}\\) is the intercept, or expected average carapace length, in millimeters, when the average August temperature is 0º C and site is held constant (for our reference site, AQUE)\n\\(\\beta_{1}\\) is the slope or expected change in average carapace length given a 1 unit change in average temperature (1º C), when site is held constant (for our reference site, AQUE)\n\\(\\beta_{2}\\) is the difference in slope or expected change in average carapace length given a 1 unit change in average temperature (1º C) between our reference group (site AQUE) and each other site.\n\\(\\varepsilon\\) is our error term, containing everything else that impacts average expected carapace length as measured in August.\n\nOnce again, whenever I say “average”, followed by any term, I’m referring to the average of that variable as measured in August of each year.\nMultiple Regression: \\[\\mu CL_i =\\beta_{0}+\\beta_{1} \\mu Temp_i +\\beta_{2} \\text Site+\\varepsilon_i\\]\n\n\nCode\n# run simple linear regression on temp and size, taking temperature differences at each site into account\n\n# for august-only data\nlobster_temp_reg_august &lt;- lm(formula = avg_size ~ avg_temp + site, data = lobster_temps_august)\n# summary(lobster_temp_reg_august)\n\n\n# for september-inclusive lobster data and august-only water temp data\nlobster_temp_reg &lt;- lm(formula = avg_size ~ avg_temp + site, data = lobster_temps_all)\n# summary(lobster_temp_reg)\n\n\n# use sjPlot to show a comparison of the outputs from running these models\n\nsjPlot::tab_model(lobster_temp_reg_august, lobster_temp_reg,\n                  #

This positive value is perhaps a sign that something more complicated is going on at this site, or perhaps in general. It also doesn’t seem to align with the visual evidence in our average temperature- and average CL-by-site plot earlier: following the temperature spike in 2015, the sample average carapace length fell, and after average temperatures began to decrease significantly following the 2018 temperature spike, the NAPL site showed a steadily, significantly increasing sample average carapace length.\n\n\\(R^2\\):\nBecause we have multiple terms on the right side of the equation (temp + site), the adjusted \\(R^2\\) value is more relevant and better representative of our model. This adjusted \\(R^2\\) value tells us that around 38% of the variation in our data can be explained by our model, or that 38% of the change in average carapace length in August can be explained by the average reef bottom temperature in August and which study site the lobster is located in.\nInterpreting Uncertainty, Significance:\nThere is notably more uncertainty in the September-inclusive regression than in the regression run on data collected exclusively in August, with wider confidence intervals and fewer estimates holding under an \\(\\alpha\\) of 0.05 (bolded p-values).\nThe intercept estimate is a significant yet nonsensical estimate, with a significance level of 0 being met in both regressions.\nIn both regression summaries, the Naples reef site has it’s own relationship between average water temperature and average carapace length going in a different direction than all of the other sites – yet it’s the most statistically significant estimate of all of our sites.\nThe Arroyo Quemado Reef site has a statistically significant estimate under the August regression, but not under the August & September regression. This makes sense intuitively, as the variation in carapace size and temperature in September does not follow the same pattern as the rest of our data (temperatures in September are cooler than August, and the carapace sizes of our lobsters will continue to grow). From here on out, we will only be using August data in our regression models.\n\n\n\n\nAs temperatures vary in each site, we can add an interaction term to our model to see if this may be a factor that impacts or is contributing to our uncertainty. This new equation is:\n\\[\\mu CL_i =\\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1} \\mu Temp_i +\\beta_{2} \\text Site + \\beta_{3} (\\mu Temp_{i} * \\text Site) +  \\varepsilon_i\\] Where:\n\n\\(\\mu CL\\) is the average carapace length, in millimeters, in August\n\\(\\beta_{0}\\) is the intercept, or expected average carapace length, in millimeters, when the average August temperature is 0º C and site is held constant (for our reference site, AQUE)\n\\(\\beta_{1}\\) is the slope or expected change in average carapace length given a 1 unit change in average temperature (1º C) in August, when site is held constant (for our reference site, AQUE)\n\\(\\beta_{2}\\) is the difference in slope or expected change in average carapace length given a 1 unit change in average temperature (1º C) in August between our reference group (site AQUE) and each other site.\n\\(\\beta_{3}\\) is the difference in slopes between our different sites, where slope is the average change in carapace length in August given a 1º C change in average reef bottom temperature in August for each site\n\\(\\varepsilon\\) is our error term, containing everything else that impacts average expected carapace length as measured in August.\n\nNow that we know what our equation means, let’s run the multiple regression with this added interaction term on our August-only dataset:\n\n\nCode\n# run multiple linear regression on temp and size, taking temperature differences at each site into account\n\n# for august-only data\nmulti_reg_int_aug &lt;- lm(formula = avg_size ~ avg_temp + site + avg_temp:site,\n                        data = lobster_temps_august)\n\n# summary(multi_reg_int_aug)\n\n# use sjPlot to show a comparison of the outputs from running these models\n\n\nsjPlot::tab_model(multi_reg_int_aug,\n                  title = \"Multiple regression with interaction\",\n                  dv.labels = c(\"\"),\n                #  dv.labels = c(\"Average lobster carapace length (mm)\"),\n                  digits = 3)\n\n\n\nMultiple regression with interaction\n\n\nPredictors\nEstimates\nCI\np\n\n\n(Intercept)\n114.066\n73.977 – 154.154\n&lt;0.001\n\n\navg temp\n-2.315\n-4.615 – -0.015\n0.049\n\n\nsite [CARP]\n-35.333\n-88.638 – 17.972\n0.188\n\n\nsite [IVEE]\n-31.745\n-86.520 – 23.030\n0.249\n\n\nsite [MOHK]\n-23.659\n-78.688 – 31.370\n0.391\n\n\nsite [NAPL]\n-2.429\n-55.379 – 50.521\n0.927\n\n\navg temp × site [CARP]\n2.064\n-1.007 – 5.136\n0.182\n\n\navg temp × site [IVEE]\n1.875\n-1.369 – 5.118\n0.250\n\n\navg temp × site [MOHK]\n1.241\n-1.940 – 4.421\n0.436\n\n\navg temp × site [NAPL]\n0.526\n-2.543 – 3.595\n0.731\n\n\nObservations\n53\n\n\nR2 / R2 adjusted\n0.469 / 0.358\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeveral new features stand out in this regression output. The first is the change in extremity of our estimated site coefficients. The first avg temp coefficient can be interpreted as the expected change in average carapace length (mm) in August given a 1 unit change in our temperature variable (1º C increase in average temperature in August) holding site constant, at our reference group site AQUE.\nThe small p-value suggests that the probability of getting results at least as extreme as this if the null hypothesis were true is very low. That being said, only our nonsensical intercept and first coefficient, avg_temp, are statistically significant under an \\(\\alpha\\) of 0.05. In this interaction model, we got an adjusted \\(R^2\\) value of around 0.36, which would suggest that roughly 36% of the variation in our data can be explained by our model, the low significance levels coupled with the higher adjusted \\(R^2\\) value in our non-interaction multiple regression model on August-only data of roughly 0.38 or 38% suggests that incorporating this interaction term does not yield a better model for our sample data.\nThe coefficients labeled avg temp x site [XXXX] are the site specific differences in slopes for average reef bottom temperature from the slope of site AQUE described above (avg temp). None of these coefficient estimates are significant, which indicates that the effect of average reef bottom temperature is not meaningfully different across the study sites.\nBased on the nuances in the coefficients and uncertainty in the two previous models, I decided to model each site individually in a simple linear regression model.\n\n\n\n\nWe can also run our linear regression model on each site, which would shift our first multiple regression equation to a simple linear model of:\n\\[\\mu CL_i =\\beta_{0}+\\beta_{1} \\mu Temp_i +\\varepsilon_i\\] where:\n\n\\(\\mu CL\\) is the average carapace length, in millimeters, in August at the site that we’re running this regression for\n\\(\\beta_{0}\\) is the intercept, or expected average carapace length, in millimeters, when the average August temperature is 0º Celsius\n\\(\\beta_{1}\\) is the slope or expected change in average carapace length in August given a 1 unit (1º C) change in average temperature in August\n\nThe main change here is that our \\(\\beta_{0}\\) and \\(\\beta_{1}\\) terms are now about the particular site we’re running our regression model on, rather than having a clause of “holding site constant” or based on a reference group (site AQUE, previously).\n\n\nCode\n# to quickly make individual subsets for each site, we can make a subset function:\n\nsite_selection &lt;- function(siteID, data_set){\n  data_set %&gt;% filter(site %in% c(siteID))\n}\n\n# then apply this function for each site:\naque_subset &lt;- site_selection(\"AQUE\", lobster_temps_august)\ncarp_subset &lt;- site_selection(\"CARP\", lobster_temps_august)\nivee_subset &lt;- site_selection(\"IVEE\", lobster_temps_august)\nmohk_subset &lt;- site_selection(\"MOHK\", lobster_temps_august)\nnapl_subset &lt;- site_selection(\"NAPL\", lobster_temps_august)\n\n\naque_simple_reg &lt;- lm(formula = avg_size ~ avg_temp, data = aque_subset)\ncarp_simple_reg &lt;- lm(formula = avg_size ~ avg_temp, data = carp_subset)\nivee_simple_reg &lt;- lm(formula = avg_size ~ avg_temp, data = ivee_subset)\nmohk_simple_reg &lt;- lm(formula = avg_size ~ avg_temp, data = mohk_subset)\nnapl_simple_reg &lt;- lm(formula = avg_size ~ avg_temp, data = napl_subset)\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# show the 3 non-MPA sites' regression outputs\nsjPlot::tab_model(aque_simple_reg, carp_simple_reg, mohk_simple_reg, \n                  title = \"Simple linear regression: SBC LTER Reef study sites (not in MPAs)\",\n                  dv.labels = c(\"Arroyo Quemado\", \"Carpinteria\", \"Mohawk\"),\n                  digits = 3)\n\n\n\nSimple linear regression: SBC LTER Reef study sites (not in MPAs)\n\n\n \nArroyo Quemado\nCarpinteria\nMohawk\n\n\nPredictors\nEstimates\nCI\np\nEstimates\nCI\np\nEstimates\nCI\np\n\n\n(Intercept)\n114.066\n77.205 – 150.926\n&lt;0.001\n78.733\n49.689 – 107.776\n&lt;0.001\n90.407\n51.685 – 129.129\n0.001\n\n\navg temp\n-2.315\n-4.430 – -0.200\n0.036\n-0.250\n-1.933 – 1.432\n0.744\n-1.074\n-3.330 – 1.182\n0.304\n\n\nObservations\n10\n11\n10\n\n\nR2 / R2 adjusted\n0.443 / 0.374\n0.012 / -0.097\n0.131 / 0.022\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# show the 2 MPA sites' regression outputs\nsjPlot::tab_model(ivee_simple_reg, napl_simple_reg, \n                  title = \"Simple linear regression: SBC LTER Reef study sites (within MPAs)\",\n                  dv.labels = c(\"Isla Vista Reef\", \"Naples Reef\"),\n                  digits = 3)\n\n\n\nSimple linear regression: SBC LTER Reef study sites (within MPAs)\n\n\n \nIsla Vista Reef\nNaples Reef\n\n\nPredictors\nEstimates\nCI\np\nEstimates\nCI\np\n\n\n(Intercept)\n82.321\n37.505 – 127.136\n0.002\n111.637\n59.623 – 163.651\n0.001\n\n\navg temp\n-0.440\n-3.187 – 2.306\n0.725\n-1.789\n-4.843 – 1.265\n0.218\n\n\nObservations\n11\n11\n\n\nR2 / R2 adjusted\n0.014 / -0.095\n0.163 / 0.070\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI was genuinely surprised by these outputs. I expected the individual relationships between average lobster size (carapace length) and average reef bottom temperature to be stronger and more statistically significant when broken down on a simple site-by-site level.\nI particularly expected to see a new, negative estimate for the Naples reef site, which had previously had an oddly highly positive estimate that was surprisingly statistically significant under an \\(\\alpha\\) level of 0.0001. When isolating that site’s data, we now have a negative estimate of roughly -1.8, but a p-value of 0.2, which is much larger than the previous p-value. This means that the probability of getting results at least as extreme as ours if the null hypothesis were true is around 20%.\nBecause these are simple linear models, we can use the \\(R^2\\) values in our interpretation of the results, rather than the adjusted \\(R^2\\) values.\n\nThe highest \\(R^2\\) value was at the Arroyo Quemado reef site, with a value of 0.44, meaning that around 44% of the variation in our data at the AQUE site can be explained by our model, or 44% of the variation in average lobster carapace size in August can be explained by the average reef bottom temperature in August. With both the intercept (nonsensical) and average temperature coefficient being statistically significant results under an \\(\\alpha\\) level of 0.05, this is an exciting result.\n\nThat’s pretty much where the statistically significant “good news” ends, though classifying this as “good” or “bad” is wrong and limits our ability to learn from these results :)\n\nThe next-highest \\(R^2\\) value is from our Naples Reef regression, and it tells us that roughly 16% of the variation in our Naples Reef data can be explained by our model. I explained the significance of the estimates earlier, and they ultimately lead me to think that there is a lot more going on at the Naples site that is impacting average lobster size than just average reef bottom temperature.\nThe third-highest \\(R^2\\) value is from the Mohawk Reef regression output and suggests that around 13% of the variation in the Mohawk Reef data can be explained by our model (change in average reef bottom temperatures in August). The nonsensical intercept of 90 has a high significance level, and the estimate for the average temperature coefficient is roughly -1.1, which means that for a 1 unit change in average reef bottom temperature in August, average lobster carapace size in August at the Mohawk Reef site is expected to decrease by around 1.1 mm. This estimate has a p-value of 0.3, which is not statistically significant under our \\(\\alpha\\) level of 0.05.\n\nThe other two sites – Carpinteria Reef and Isla Vista Reef – have high p-values for their coefficient estimates and very low \\(R^2\\) values, with just under 1.5% of the variation in the data able to be explained by the models.\nSome key takeaways from this are that the Naples site results particularly changed after being separated from the rest of the data – the sign and degree of the temperature coefficient changed, though its significance level decreased and had a relatively low \\(R^2\\) value.\nAnother key takeaway is that our model works fairly well for the data at the Arroyo Quemado site: we obtained statistically significant estimates and an \\(R^2\\) value of 0.44 with just one term on the right side of the equation. This means that roughly 44% of the variation in our data at this site can be explained by average reef bottom temperature in August.\nA significant limitation to this approach is that each model is run on a very limited dataset of only 10 points – yearly averages from 2012-2022 leaves us with 11 points per subset for all sites other than AQUE, which has 10 due to the lack of August lobster size data in 2014, and MOHK, which has 10 due to the lack of August temperature data in 2017.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe limitations of the lobster data and the low quantity of statistically significant results lead me to question the strength of the results in this study for the most part. One notable exception has been with the Arroyo Quemado Reef data, where – with a simple linear model – the regression results suggest that roughly 44% of the variation in the average lobster carapace size data collected in August at that site can be explained by average reef bottom temperatures in August.\nEarly on in my data analysis process, I considered dropping the AQUE site altogether due to its missing August data in 2014 and unique presence of September data in that year. After continuing on with my analysis, eventually making subsets with and without that September data, running various levels of regression, and plotting averages left and right, I came to appreciate the challenge that this data posed. If I had dropped it, I would have completely missed the most statistically significant result in the whole dataset.\nIt was interesting to see the clear spikes in average reef bottom temperatures in August across all sites in 2015 and 2018, as it shows that our reef bottom temperature data reflects the natural phenomena discussed: 2015/2016 El Niño and the extreme warming of coastal temperatures in Southern California in 2018. All sites saw a decrease in average carapace length in August of 2015 from previous years, which may indicate that there were fewer individuals with larger carapace lengths at all sites when these warming events occurred.\nOverall, the only site that I can make any sort of statistically grounded claim about is the Arroyo Quemado Reef, and even then, with the limited number of data points yielded when taking averages of carapace length and temperature in the month of August over a 10 year period, the final conclusion I have come to is that this subject demands further study and investigation. Science isn’t perfect, and we don’t always get statistically significant results. There is validity and truth in this fact, and protecting primary studies from the pressure to yield statistically significant results is essential, as results that are not statistically significant can still teach us about the population(s) we are trying to study.\n\n\n\nGiven more time and resources, there are a few elements of this analysis that I would change and several “next steps” that would be interesting to pursue.\nAs I have mentioned throughout this notebook, the limitations of the data at various steps proved challenging. I’ve already discussed the challenges of the September 2014 data, but I was also frustrated by the lack of temperature data for the Mohawk site in August of 2017. While I considered using functions like na.approx from the zoo package to make up for this, I ultimately ran out of time to fully achieve the outputs that would make including these steps worthwhile.\nI also attempted to investigate the possible impact that MPA status (whether or not a site falls within a Marine Protected Area) had on the relationship between average August temperature and size, I also failed to get this code to yield any satisfactory outputs.\n\n\n\nBris, A.

This is a gross generalization, and there are many nuances, including casually disseminated lobster facts and information, special close-ups on rare lobsters (sometimes blue, recently a 1-in-50 million chance half-blue-half-red lobster named Bowie.\nI later learned that Maine Lobster fisheries are threatened by climate change, with rising sea temperatures and environmental pressures pushing American Lobster (Homarus americanus) populations farther north or into general decline if not managed appropriately 1, 2, 3. Intense warming in waters on the East Coast coupled with failure to act and adapt quickly enough has already led to the collapse of the Gulf of Maine cod fishery 4.\nLobsters are sensitive to change, and it can impact their behavior5. Recent studies suggests that changing sea temperatures have implications on the size at which Homarus americanus reach maturity, and bacterial diversity and cultivability 6, 7. Warming that impacts areas that juvenile lobsters rely on can lead them to become inhospitable, which is particularly dangerous as the Gulf of Maine has been warming at a rate faster than 99% of the world’s oceans 8, 9.\nGiven all of this established background and concern over the American Lobsters, as a Santa Barbara resident and lifelong fan of the California coast and all of its marine life, I wondered if the California Spiny Lobster Panulirus interruptus, was facing similar threats.\n\nImage credits: Brett Seymour for NPS\nThe species is currently listed as a species of “least concern” on the IUCN Redlist, and their populations have been managed by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife for decades. If you aren’t already convinced, I’m happy to inform you that the CA Spiny Lobster is significant both economically and ecologically. In the 2017-2018 fishing season, the commercial fishery accounted for roughly $12.7 million in ex-vessel value, and the recreational fishery contributes “between $33-40 million in consumer spending to the California economy each year.” 10\nDo you think kelp forests are cool? Well, these lobsters are also a keystone species in California’s kelp forest ecosystems. They’re a key predator of purple sea urchins, which love to eat the Giant Kelp that the rest of the ecosystem depends on. Spiny lobsters relieve this predation (urchin grazing) on Giant Kelp forests and as many larger fish prey on these lobsters, they are a key, mid-trophic level species11. They typically forage at night, and according to the CADFW’s Marine Species Portal, “the Spiny lobster provides an important role in the ecology of rocky reefs, and it is associated with critical habitats such as surfgrass beds.” 12\nThe Santa Barbara Coast and the Channel Islands National Park are key areas of the California Spiny Lobsters’ habitat:\n\nThe presence of eelgrass or surfgrass in the rocky reefs in these areas also provide critical habitat for the 11 larval stages of Spiny lobsters.\nPanulirus interruptus are estimated to reach sexual maturity at around 5-7 years old (Females typically take longer to mature) which is estimated by a carapace length of 2.5 inches, or 63.5 millimeters 13. The CA Department of Fish & Wildlife manages the Spiny Lobster populations in part by restricting the months during which it is legal to hunt/fish for them. The fishing season is from early October to mid-March, which allows populations to recover in the off-season, as this species has a complex reproductive cycle and needs to molt (shed their exoskeleton) which makes them especially vulnerable to predation. The legal catch size is 3.25 inches, or 82.55 millimeters 14. Overall, it seems that the populations are able to remain stable thanks to the careful management of the CADFW.\n\nThis diagram labels key attributes of the California Spiny Lobster, including the area that is measured to obtain the carapace length (CL) measurements used in determining maturity, catch length, and as a proxy for age.\nI also became interested in investigating how the 2015/2016 El Niño may have impacted Spiny lobster populations, as it was the most extreme El Niño in the previous 145 years15. With the warmer sea surface temperatures associated with El Niño events, would we see populations being impacted on the Santa Barbara Coast?\n\n\nThe Santa Barbara Coastal Long Term Ecological Research project (SBC LTER) has many study sites at which a wide variety of data are collected, from fish abundance and population dynamics to complex water chemistry and temperature data. Using this data and the context given above, I tried to answer the question: What is the relationship between California Spiny Lobster populations and reef bottom temperatures?\nTo investigate the relationship between CA Spiny Lobsters populations and reef bottom temperatures, I used carapace length as it is the primary size metric for lobsters and is used as a proxy measurement for age, which can help provide information about the population structure at various reef sites. I also used reef bottom temperatures (as apposed to sea surface temperatures (SST). All of this data was collected at reef study sites in the SBC LTER network.\nThe five SBC LTER Reef sites that I’ll be using data from in this analysis are:\n\nArroyo Quemado Reef: site code “AQUE”\n\ndepth range: 5.4 meters to 10.7 meters\n\nNaples Reef: site code “NAPL”\n\ndepth range: 5.9 m to 13.4 m\n\nIsla Vista Reef: site code “IVEE”:\n\ndepth range: 8.2 m to 8.8 m\n\nMohawk Reef: site code “MOHK”:\n\ndepth range: 4.5 m to 6.0 m\n\nCarpinteria Reef: site code “CARP”:\n\ndepth range: -2.2 m to -8.8 m\n\n\nI’ve labeled these on a screenshot of a geographically contextual rendered map preview from the SBC LTER wesite:\n\nTwo of these sites, Naples (NAPL) and Isla Vista (IVEE), indicated with a black line connecting them, are in Marine Protected Areas (MPAs)."

Because this data collection began in 2012, leaving out the 2014 September data for the AQUE site would mean only have 2 years of precedent before the El Niño event. Having only\nDue to the nature of lobster carapace size increasing over time (positive age-size relationship), if we include the 2014 September data for AQUE, we could get a falsely high “baseline” carapace size for that study site before the El Niño event, which could skew our results. An additional concern I have is about how our average Reef bottom temperature data will interact in all of this. Sea surface temperatures fluctuate over time and both seasonal variation and wind levels can impact ocean temperatures on the California Coast 16,17.\nAnother issue that comes up with excluding 2014 data for the AQUE study site is that in all other sites, the average carapace size (mm) was greater in 2014 than in 2013. This could mean that by excluding 2014 data for the AQUE study site, in our attempt to avoid a falsely high baseline/comparison point, we are obtaining a falsely low one. If we include both months of 2014 data, the IVEE study site is also skewed to have higher average carapace sizes for that year, as I’ll show later.\nTo address this discrepancy in the data, In my analysis, I will make two subsets: one in which we keep all of our data (denoted in our outputs as August data and August & September data), and the other will only include data collected in August. We can compare the results of our statistical analyses as we go."

There is also a subtle change at the IVEE study site between 2014 and 2015 between the two plots as well, supporting what we know about how carapace lengths increase over time, even on a monthly level.\n\nTaking the average size (carapace length) per site per year shows potentially interesting trends. At all sites, there is a notable drop in average carapace length (mm) from 2014 to 2015, both including and excluding September 2014 data. This significant change in slope of the lines connecting data points for average carapace length coincides with the 2015/2016 El Niño, which was the strongest over a 145 year record 21. During El Niño events, sea surface temperatures (SST) rise, and SST estimates can also serve as an indicator for coastal ocean temperature levels – if SST is rising, the temperatures at the bottom of relatively shallow, coastal reef sites are likely rising as well. In some cases, depending on the thermocline (inverted or not) that a reef experiences, Sea Bottom Temperatures (SBT) can even be higher than SST 22.\nThese visualizations suggests that the Santa Barbara Coast LTER sites are somewhat of a haven for California Spiny lobsters in their first few of years of breeding, as stated on the CADFW info page on the California Spiny lobster. As this graph shows an average carapace size, and lobsters can vary significantly in size depending on their age, these research sites are likely home to a wide age and developmental stage range of lobsters.\nLet’s move on to incorporate the other essential data in investigating the relationship between reef bottom temperatures and average lobster size (carapace length, mm), – Reef bottom temperature!\n\n\n\n\nOur reef bottom temperature data is pretty huge – temperatures were recorded every 15 minutes at multiple SBC LTER study sites since 2002.\nRegarding our previous dilemma of “to include or not to include” September carapace length data, we now have an opportunity to decide how we want to aggregate our reef bottom temperature data. I could filter it by month, keeping temperature records only from the month of August, or I could include September as well. I could also have another different subset, which incorporates temperature data from August and September only at sites IVEE and AQUE for 2014, and filter it to only keep August dates for all other sites that year and all sites at all years. This can get pretty complicated pretty quickly, as the easiest inclusive option – filtering just for August and September – has the drawback of interfering with the estimated relationship between average carapace length and water temperature for the majority of our data.\nIn my analysis, I’ve decided to only select reef bottom temperature records in the month of August, which I then average and join with the lobster data by year and by site.\nFirst, we’ll plot the average August reef bottom temperature per year across all sites, noting the spike in temperature in the first year of the 2015/2016 El Niño. This dataset ranges from 2002 to 2023, but the last month of the record is July, so we’ll have August data spanning from 2002-2023 before we join it with our lobster data set. Then, we’ll plot the average August temperatures over time by site, comparing with the average size by site plot created earlier.\n\n\nCode\n# prepping water temp data to compare with lobster data\n\n# finding average August reef bottom temperatures across all sites over \n# the full time range of our water dataset (2002-2022)\nallsites_aug_temps &lt;- water_data %&gt;% \n  filter(month %in% c(8)) |&gt; # select August temps\n  filter(site %in% c((unique(lobster_size$site)))) %&gt;% # selecting Lobster data study sites\n  group_by(year) %&gt;%  \n  summarize(avg_temp = mean(temp_c, na.rm = TRUE)) # find avg temp\n\n\naugust_temps &lt;- water_data %&gt;%\n  filter(site %in% c((unique(lobster_size$site)))) %&gt;% \n  filter(month == 8)\n\nmean_aug_temp &lt;- mean(august_temps$temp_c)\n\nprint(paste0(\"The average August reef bottom temperature across the 5 reef study sites from 2002-2022 is \", round(mean_aug_temp, 2), \"ºC.\"))\n\n\n[1] \"The average August reef bottom temperature across the 5 reef study sites from 2002-2022 is 16.19ºC.\"\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# making a subset to show selected year range\nallsites_aug_temp_plot &lt;- ggplot(data = allsites_aug_temps) +\n  geom_point(aes(x = year, \n                 y = avg_temp)) +\n  geom_line(aes(x = year, \n                y = avg_temp)) +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 2015,  linetype = \"dotted\") + # showing 2015 El Niño \n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = (seq(2000,2022, by = 5)), \n                     minor_breaks = seq(2002, 2022, by = 1)) +\n  theme_bw() +\n  labs(title = \"Average Reef Bottom Temperatures in August Over Time\",\n       subtitle = \"across selected SBC LTER study sites (2002-2022)\", \n       x = \"Year\",\n       y = \"Average Temperature (ºC)\") +\n  annotate(\"text\", x=2014, y=19, label=\"El Niño\", angle=0) \n\n\nallsites_aug_temp_plot\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is a clear spike in average reef bottom temperature in August of 2015 across all study sites, and a significant dip in 2010. There is also a notable spike (and maximum peak) at all sites in 2018. There were record-breaking SST anomalies in 2018 at many points along the Southern California Coastline, particularly along La Jolla, San Diego, where the Scripps Institution of Oceanography recorded water temperatures of 25.9 degrees Celsius, beating the previous record of 25.8 C from 1931 23, 24.\nNow we’ll join the lobster size data and the temperature data, which will narrow our time range to 2012-2022.\n\n\nCode\n# making august-only water temp subset\naugust_site_temps &lt;- water_data %&gt;%  \n  filter(month(date) %in% c(8)) %&gt;%  # select August temps\n  filter(site %in% c((unique(lobster_size$site)))) %&gt;%  # selecting Lobster data study sites\n  group_by(year, site) %&gt;%  # grouping by year and site to join (only 1 month, no need to group by it)\n  summarize(avg_temp = mean(temp_c, na.rm = TRUE)) # find avg temp\n\n\nlobster_temps_august &lt;- inner_join(lobster_august, august_site_temps) %&gt;% \n  select(-max_size, -min_size)\n\n\n# this will make sure that we're comparing the same month for each site and each year, \n# so for most years, sites, and months, it'll be august data\n# but for the 2014 AQUE and IVEE data collected in September,\n\nsite_temps &lt;- water_data %&gt;%  \n  filter(month(date) %in% c(8, 9)) %&gt;%  # select August and September temps\n  filter(site %in% c((unique(lobster_size$site)))) %&gt;%   # selecting Lobster data study sites\n  group_by(year, month, site) %&gt;%  # grouping by year, month, and site, so we can join by all \n  summarize(avg_temp = mean(temp_c, na.rm = TRUE)) # find avg temp\n\n# we'll be pairing those averages with average temperature in September\nlobster_temps_all &lt;- inner_join(site_temps,\n                                lobster_all) %&gt;%  # this df also has maintained its \"month\" column\n  select(-max_size, -min_size)\n\n\n\nAvg.

The dashed horizontal lines in the temperature plots show the 20-year average August reef bottom temperature (from 2002-2022). The dashed horizontal lines in the average size plot show the carapace lengths at sexual maturity (lower) and catch size (higher).\nComparing our average temperature and average size plots side by side, there seems to be visual evidence for some trends or relationship between average temperature and average carapace length. At all sites, in 2015 when the average August temperature spikes, average carapace lengths decrease. At the Naples reef site, after the temperature spikes in 2018 and falls dramatically in 2019, we see a spike in average carapace length in 2019. As average August reef bottom temperatures continue to fall in 2020 in Naples, lower than the average temperature over the previous 8 years, the average carapace size seems to drop slightly at that site. The most extreme drops in average carapace length at sites Arroyo Quemado, Carpinteria, and Mohawk happen when the temperature spikes in 2015. When temperatures fall back down closer to the 20-year average August reef bottom temperature in 2016, the Arroyo Quemado reef site is the only site where average carapace lengths seem to recover within that annual cycle. Unfortunately, we are missing temperature data at the Mohawk reef site in 2017. Overall, there seem to be complexities in the population structures at all sites, with similar overall trends in average August reef bottom temperature."

This positive value is perhaps a sign that something more complicated is going on at this site, or perhaps in general. It also doesn’t seem to align with the visual evidence in our average temperature- and average CL-by-site plot earlier: following the temperature spike in 2015, the sample average carapace length fell, and after average temperatures began to decrease significantly following the 2018 temperature spike, the NAPL site showed a steadily, significantly increasing sample average carapace length.\n\n\\(R^2\\):\nBecause we have multiple terms on the right side of the equation (temp + site), the adjusted \\(R^2\\) value is more relevant and better representative of our model. This adjusted \\(R^2\\) value tells us that around 38% of the variation in our data can be explained by our model, or that 38% of the change in average carapace length in August can be explained by the average reef bottom temperature in August and which study site the lobster is located in.\nInterpreting Uncertainty, Significance:\nThere is notably more uncertainty in the September-inclusive regression than in the regression run on data collected exclusively in August, with wider confidence intervals and fewer estimates holding under an \\(\\alpha\\) of 0.05 (bolded p-values).\nThe intercept estimate is a significant yet nonsensical estimate, with a significance level of 0 being met in both regressions.\nIn both regression summaries, the Naples reef site has it’s own relationship between average water temperature and average carapace length going in a different direction than all of the other sites – yet it’s the most statistically significant estimate of all of our sites.\nThe Arroyo Quemado Reef site has a statistically significant estimate under the August regression, but not under the August & September regression. This makes sense intuitively, as the variation in carapace size and temperature in September does not follow the same pattern as the rest of our data (temperatures in September are cooler than August, and the carapace sizes of our lobsters will continue to grow). From here on out, we will only be using August data in our regression models.\n\n\n\n\nAs temperatures vary in each site, we can add an interaction term to our model to see if this may be a factor that impacts or is contributing to our uncertainty. This new equation is:\n\\[\\mu CL_i =\\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1} \\mu Temp_i +\\beta_{2} \\text Site + \\beta_{3} (\\mu Temp_{i} * \\text Site) +  \\varepsilon_i\\] Where:\n\n\\(\\mu CL\\) is the average carapace length, in millimeters, in August\n\\(\\beta_{0}\\) is the intercept, or expected average carapace length, in millimeters, when the average August temperature is 0º C and site is held constant (for our reference site, AQUE)\n\\(\\beta_{1}\\) is the slope or expected change in average carapace length given a 1 unit change in average temperature (1º C) in August, when site is held constant (for our reference site, AQUE)\n\\(\\beta_{2}\\) is the difference in slope or expected change in average carapace length given a 1 unit change in average temperature (1º C) in August between our reference group (site AQUE) and each other site.\n\\(\\beta_{3}\\) is the difference in slopes between our different sites, where slope is the average change in carapace length in August given a 1º C change in average reef bottom temperature in August for each site\n\\(\\varepsilon\\) is our error term, containing everything else that impacts average expected carapace length as measured in August.\n\nNow that we know what our equation means, let’s run the multiple regression with this added interaction term on our August-only dataset:\n\n\nCode\n# run multiple linear regression on temp and size, taking temperature differences at each site into account\n\n# for august-only data\nmulti_reg_int_aug &lt;- lm(formula = avg_size ~ avg_temp + site + avg_temp:site,\n                        data = lobster_temps_august)\n\n# summary(multi_reg_int_aug)\n\n# use sjPlot to show a comparison of the outputs from running these models\n\n\nsjPlot::tab_model(multi_reg_int_aug,\n                  title = \"Multiple regression with interaction\",\n                  dv.labels = c(\"\"),\n                #  dv.labels = c(\"Average lobster carapace length (mm)\"),\n                  digits = 3)\n\n\n\nMultiple regression with interaction\n\n\nPredictors\nEstimates\nCI\np\n\n\n(Intercept)\n114.066\n73.977 – 154.154\n&lt;0.001\n\n\navg temp\n-2.315\n-4.615 – -0.015\n0.049\n\n\nsite [CARP]\n-35.333\n-88.638 – 17.972\n0.188\n\n\nsite [IVEE]\n-31.745\n-86.520 – 23.030\n0.249\n\n\nsite [MOHK]\n-23.659\n-78.688 – 31.370\n0.391\n\n\nsite [NAPL]\n-2.429\n-55.379 – 50.521\n0.927\n\n\navg temp × site [CARP]\n2.064\n-1.007 – 5.136\n0.182\n\n\navg temp × site [IVEE]\n1.875\n-1.369 – 5.118\n0.250\n\n\navg temp × site [MOHK]\n1.241\n-1.940 – 4.421\n0.436\n\n\navg temp × site [NAPL]\n0.526\n-2.543 – 3.595\n0.731\n\n\nObservations\n53\n\n\nR2 / R2 adjusted\n0.469 / 0.358\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeveral new features stand out in this regression output. The first is the change in extremity of our estimated site coefficients. The first avg temp coefficient can be interpreted as the expected change in average carapace length (mm) in August given a 1 unit change in our temperature variable (1º C increase in average temperature in August) holding site constant, at our reference group site AQUE.\nThe small p-value suggests that the probability of getting results at least as extreme as this if the null hypothesis were true is very low. That being said, only our nonsensical intercept and first coefficient, avg_temp, are statistically significant under an \\(\\alpha\\) of 0.05. In this interaction model, we got an adjusted \\(R^2\\) value of around 0.36, which would suggest that roughly 36% of the variation in our data can be explained by our model, the low significance levels coupled with the higher adjusted \\(R^2\\) value in our non-interaction multiple regression model on August-only data of roughly 0.38 or 38% suggests that incorporating this interaction term does not yield a better model for our sample data.\nThe coefficients labeled avg temp x site [XXXX] are the site specific differences in slopes for average reef bottom temperature from the slope of site AQUE described above (avg temp). None of these coefficient estimates are significant, which indicates that the effect of average reef bottom temperature is not meaningfully different across the study sites.\nBased on the nuances in the coefficients and uncertainty in the two previous models, I decided to model each site individually in a simple linear regression model.\n\n\n\n\nWe can also run our linear regression model on each site, which would shift our first multiple regression equation to a simple linear model of:\n\\[\\mu CL_i =\\beta_{0}+\\beta_{1} \\mu Temp_i +\\varepsilon_i\\] where:\n\n\\(\\mu CL\\) is the average carapace length, in millimeters, in August at the site that we’re running this regression for\n\\(\\beta_{0}\\) is the intercept, or expected average carapace length, in millimeters, when the average August temperature is 0º Celsius\n\\(\\beta_{1}\\) is the slope or expected change in average carapace length in August given a 1 unit (1º C) change in average temperature in August\n\nThe main change here is that our \\(\\beta_{0}\\) and \\(\\beta_{1}\\) terms are now about the particular site we’re running our regression model on, rather than having a clause of “holding site constant” or based on a reference group (site AQUE, previously).\n\n\nCode\n# to quickly make individual subsets for each site, we can make a subset function:\n\nsite_selection &lt;- function(siteID, data_set){\n  data_set %&gt;% filter(site %in% c(siteID))\n}\n\n# then apply this function for each site:\naque_subset &lt;- site_selection(\"AQUE\", lobster_temps_august)\ncarp_subset &lt;- site_selection(\"CARP\", lobster_temps_august)\nivee_subset &lt;- site_selection(\"IVEE\", lobster_temps_august)\nmohk_subset &lt;- site_selection(\"MOHK\", lobster_temps_august)\nnapl_subset &lt;- site_selection(\"NAPL\", lobster_temps_august)\n\n\naque_simple_reg &lt;- lm(formula = avg_size ~ avg_temp, data = aque_subset)\ncarp_simple_reg &lt;- lm(formula = avg_size ~ avg_temp, data = carp_subset)\nivee_simple_reg &lt;- lm(formula = avg_size ~ avg_temp, data = ivee_subset)\nmohk_simple_reg &lt;- lm(formula = avg_size ~ avg_temp, data = mohk_subset)\nnapl_simple_reg &lt;- lm(formula = avg_size ~ avg_temp, data = napl_subset)\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# show the 3 non-MPA sites' regression outputs\nsjPlot::tab_model(aque_simple_reg, carp_simple_reg, mohk_simple_reg, \n                  title = \"Simple linear regression: SBC LTER Reef study sites (not in MPAs)\",\n                  dv.labels = c(\"Arroyo Quemado\", \"Carpinteria\", \"Mohawk\"),\n                  digits = 3)\n\n\n\nSimple linear regression: SBC LTER Reef study sites (not in MPAs)\n\n\n \nArroyo Quemado\nCarpinteria\nMohawk\n\n\nPredictors\nEstimates\nCI\np\nEstimates\nCI\np\nEstimates\nCI\np\n\n\n(Intercept)\n114.066\n77.205 – 150.926\n&lt;0.001\n78.733\n49.689 – 107.776\n&lt;0.001\n90.407\n51.685 – 129.129\n0.001\n\n\navg temp\n-2.315\n-4.430 – -0.200\n0.036\n-0.250\n-1.933 – 1.432\n0.744\n-1.074\n-3.330 – 1.182\n0.304\n\n\nObservations\n10\n11\n10\n\n\nR2 / R2 adjusted\n0.443 / 0.374\n0.012 / -0.097\n0.131 / 0.022\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# show the 2 MPA sites' regression outputs\nsjPlot::tab_model(ivee_simple_reg, napl_simple_reg, \n                  title = \"Simple linear regression: SBC LTER Reef study sites (within MPAs)\",\n                  dv.labels = c(\"Isla Vista Reef\", \"Naples Reef\"),\n                  digits = 3)\n\n\n\nSimple linear regression: SBC LTER Reef study sites (within MPAs)\n\n\n \nIsla Vista Reef\nNaples Reef\n\n\nPredictors\nEstimates\nCI\np\nEstimates\nCI\np\n\n\n(Intercept)\n82.321\n37.505 – 127.136\n0.002\n111.637\n59.623 – 163.651\n0.001\n\n\navg temp\n-0.440\n-3.187 – 2.306\n0.725\n-1.789\n-4.843 – 1.265\n0.218\n\n\nObservations\n11\n11\n\n\nR2 / R2 adjusted\n0.014 / -0.095\n0.163 / 0.070\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI was genuinely surprised by these outputs. I expected the individual relationships between average lobster size (carapace length) and average reef bottom temperature to be stronger and more statistically significant when broken down on a simple site-by-site level.\nI particularly expected to see a new, negative estimate for the Naples reef site, which had previously had an oddly highly positive estimate that was surprisingly statistically significant under an \\(\\alpha\\) level of 0.0001. When isolating that site’s data, we now have a negative estimate of roughly -1.8, but a p-value of 0.2, which is much larger than the previous p-value. This means that the probability of getting results at least as extreme as ours if the null hypothesis were true is around 20%.\nBecause these are simple linear models, we can use the \\(R^2\\) values in our interpretation of the results, rather than the adjusted \\(R^2\\) values.\n\nThe highest \\(R^2\\) value was at the Arroyo Quemado reef site, with a value of 0.44, meaning that around 44% of the variation in our data at the AQUE site can be explained by our model, or 44% of the variation in average lobster carapace size in August can be explained by the average reef bottom temperature in August. With both the intercept (nonsensical) and average temperature coefficient being statistically significant results under an \\(\\alpha\\) level of 0.05, this is an exciting result.\n\nThat’s pretty much where the statistically significant “good news” ends, though classifying this as “good” or “bad” is wrong and limits our ability to learn from these results :)\n\nThe next-highest \\(R^2\\) value is from our Naples Reef regression, and it tells us that roughly 16% of the variation in our Naples Reef data can be explained by our model. I explained the significance of the estimates earlier, and they ultimately lead me to think that there is a lot more going on at the Naples site that is impacting average lobster size than just average reef bottom temperature.\nThe third-highest \\(R^2\\) value is from the Mohawk Reef regression output and suggests that around 13% of the variation in the Mohawk Reef data can be explained by our model (change in average reef bottom temperatures in August). The nonsensical intercept of 90 has a high significance level, and the estimate for the average temperature coefficient is roughly -1.1, which means that for a 1 unit change in average reef bottom temperature in August, average lobster carapace size in August at the Mohawk Reef site is expected to decrease by around 1.1 mm. This estimate has a p-value of 0.3, which is not statistically significant under our \\(\\alpha\\) level of 0.05.\n\nThe other two sites – Carpinteria Reef and Isla Vista Reef – have high p-values for their coefficient estimates and very low \\(R^2\\) values, with just under 1.5% of the variation in the data able to be explained by the models.\nSome key takeaways from this are that the Naples site results particularly changed after being separated from the rest of the data – the sign and degree of the temperature coefficient changed, though its significance level decreased and had a relatively low \\(R^2\\) value.\nAnother key takeaway is that our model works fairly well for the data at the Arroyo Quemado site: we obtained statistically significant estimates and an \\(R^2\\) value of 0.44 with just one term on the right side of the equation. This means that roughly 44% of the variation in our data at this site can be explained by average reef bottom temperature in August.\nA significant limitation to this approach is that each model is run on a very limited dataset of only 10 points – yearly averages from 2012-2022 leaves us with 11 points per subset for all sites other than AQUE, which has 10 due to the lack of August lobster size data in 2014, and MOHK, which has 10 due to the lack of August temperature data in 2017."

    "text": "The limitations of the lobster data and the low quantity of statistically significant results lead me to question the strength of the results in this study for the most part. One notable exception has been with the Arroyo Quemado Reef data, where – with a simple linear model – the regression results suggest that roughly 44% of the variation in the average lobster carapace size data collected in August at that site can be explained by average reef bottom temperatures in August.\nEarly on in my data analysis process, I considered dropping the AQUE site altogether due to its missing August data in 2014 and unique presence of September data in that year. After continuing on with my analysis, eventually making subsets with and without that September data, running various levels of regression, and plotting averages left and right, I came to appreciate the challenge that this data posed. If I had dropped it, I would have completely missed the most statistically significant result in the whole dataset.\nIt was interesting to see the clear spikes in average reef bottom temperatures in August across all sites in 2015 and 2018, as it shows that our reef bottom temperature data reflects the natural phenomena discussed: 2015/2016 El Niño and the extreme warming of coastal temperatures in Southern California in 2018. All sites saw a decrease in average carapace length in August of 2015 from previous years, which may indicate that there were fewer individuals with larger carapace lengths at all sites when these warming events occurred.\nOverall, the only site that I can make any sort of statistically grounded claim about is the Arroyo Quemado Reef, and even then, with the limited number of data points yielded when taking averages of carapace length and temperature in the month of August over a 10 year period, the final conclusion I have come to is that this subject demands further study and investigation. Science isn’t perfect, and we don’t always get statistically significant results. There is validity and truth in this fact, and protecting primary studies from the pressure to yield statistically significant results is essential, as results that are not statistically significant can still teach us about the population(s) we are trying to study."

    "text": "Given more time and resources, there are a few elements of this analysis that I would change and several “next steps” that would be interesting to pursue.\nAs I have mentioned throughout this notebook, the limitations of the data at various steps proved challenging. I’ve already discussed the challenges of the September 2014 data, but I was also frustrated by the lack of temperature data for the Mohawk site in August of 2017. While I considered using functions like na.approx from the zoo package to make up for this, I ultimately ran out of time to fully achieve the outputs that would make including these steps worthwhile.\nI also attempted to investigate the possible impact that MPA status (whether or not a site falls within a Marine Protected Area) had on the relationship between average August temperature and size, I also failed to get this code to yield any satisfactory outputs."

    "text": "Overview & Purpose\n“In February 2021, the state of Texas suffered a major power crisis, which came about as a result of three severe winter storms sweeping across the United States on February 10–11, 13–17, and 15–20.”1 For more background, check out these engineering and political perspectives. These videos succinctly convey the severity and immediate consequences of the blackouts that occurred in Texas in the winter storms of early 2021, and convey that the lasting impacts will (and should) be studied for years to come. A quick note from the practical engineering video: providers spent more money on wholesale electricity in a week than would normally be spent in 4 years (on average), and that doesn’t include the crazy natural gas prices that were soaring during this time.\nYou can also read the University of Texas at Austin, Energy Institute’s report on the timeline and events of the February 2021 blackouts for a more thorough understanding of the event. The Energy Institute’s website states: “In February 2021, an extreme winter storm event caused a massive electricity generation failure in the state of Texas, which resulted in a loss of power for more than 4.5 million homes. This failure has resulted in at least 57 deaths across 25 Texas counties and over $195 billion in property damage, bringing attention to the energy system crisis and its potential causes,” 2\nThis blog post is a summary of my geospatial data and remote sensing project on the 2021 Texas Power Crisis, specifically looking at the blackouts in the Houston metropolitan area on February 16th, 2021 (during the second of three intense winter storms, also referred to as the week of the Winter Storm Uri).\nIn the primary analysis notebook, which you can find on my GitHub repository I use VIIRS night lights data, OpenStreetMap data, and US Census Bureau data to:\n\nestimate the number of homes in Houston that lost power as a result of the first two storms\ninvestigate if socioeconomic factors are predictors of communities recovery from a power outage"

    "text": "Data\nThe data used in this project are too large to export to GitHub, so I’ve provided links to access/download the data for reproducibility below. The night lights data has been preprocessed for academic use, and the file (92.2 MB) is unfortunately too large to upload on GitHub.\n\nNight lights data\nMy analysis will be based on remotely-sensed night lights data, acquired from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) onboard the Suomi satellite. VIIRS data is distributed through NASA’s Level-1 and Atmospheric Archive & Distribution System Distributed Active Archive Center (LAADS DAAC).\nIn particular, I will use the VNP46A1 to detect differences in night lights before and after the storm to identify areas that lost electric power.\nI am using two primary nights’ data: February 7th and February 16th, as these provide the clearest view (least cloud cover) for the analysis. Many NASA Earth data products are distributed in 10x10 degree tiles in sinusoidal equal-area projection. Tiles are identified by their horizontal and vertical position in the grid. Houston lies on the border of tiles h08v05 and h08v06. For each night of data, two tiles per date (the 7th and 16th of February, 2021) were downloaded and prepared by Ruth Oliver for the Master of Environmental Data Science’s Geospatial Analysis course in the Fall quarter, 2023. Thus, there are a total of 4 separate .tif files that I read in for my analysis.\nFor improved computational efficiency and easier interoperability with sf, I use the stars package for raster handling. I read in the data using stars::read_stars().\nCitation:\nNASA Earth Data, Level-1 and Atmospheric Archive & Distribution System Distributed Active Archive Center (LAADS DAAC) [Data file] Available from: https://ladsweb.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/ Access date: October 26, 2023.\n\n\nOpenStreetMap data\nTo determine the number of homes that lost power, I link (spatially join) blackout areas with OpenStreetMap data on roads and buildings.\n\nRoads\nHighways can account for a large portion of the night lights observable from space (see Google’s Earth at Night).\nI use the roads data from OpenStreetMap to cut out the highways and associated lights (traffic, street lights) from my analysis to minimize falsely identifying these areas with reduced traffic as areas without power. Geofabrik’s download sites were used to retrieve a shapefile of all highways in Texas and prepared a Geopackage (.gpkg file) containing just the subset of roads that intersect the Houston metropolitan area. This data was also prepared by Ruth Oliver.\nThe roads Geopackage includes data on roads other than highways. I define a SQL query to select a subset of the highways from the Houston metropolitan area, and use that SQL query and subset selection to load just the highways data from the prepared Geopackage.\n\n\nHouses\nOpenStreetMap also has building data, which I use in my analysis to find the number of buildings impacted by the blackouts in the Houston Metropolitan area.\nI define another SQL query when reading in the buildings data to select only residential buildings. I will use this data to find the number of homes impacted by blackouts.\nCitation:\nGeofabrik Download Server (2018), OpenStreetMap Data Extracts [Data file] Available from: https://download.geofabrik.de/ Access date: October 26, 2023.\n\n\nUS Census Bureau data\nTo investigate potential relationships between socioeconomic status and blackout status during the 2021 winter storm, I use data from the U.S. Census Bureau’s American Community Survey for census tracts in 2019. This data is within the folder ACS_2019_5YR_TRACT_48.gdb and is an ArcGIS “file geodatabase”, a multi-file proprietary format that’s roughly analogous to a GeoPackage file. To explore the contents/layers of the geodatabase, you can access the ACS metadata\nIn my analysis, I combine the geometry with the attributes to get a feature layer that sf can use.\nI use st_read() to load the GeoDataBase (GDB) layers, first selecting the geometries layer, then (separately) selecting the layer that income data is stored in. I also select the median income field from this dataset, as I am ultimately trying to investigate into the possible relationship between socioeconomic status and blackout status.\nCitation:\nUnited States Census Bureau (2019), American Community Survey [Data file] Available from: https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs Access date: October 26, 2023."

The VIIRS night lights data is, at this point in the process, still in EPSG:4326. This is due to the CRS of my Houston metropolitan area bounding box coordinates being in the standard CRS EPSG:4326. After I crop my raster data to the area of interest using this bounding box, I will reproject both to EPSG:3083.\n\nPreliminary Visualization\nThe night lights data is still in 4 separate pieces. Here, I aggregate the raster data by combining the tiles into a single stars object for each date (2021-02-07 and 2021-02-16) and then plot the resulting composites.\nFebruary 7th is the reference night (no blackouts) and February 16th is the night from which we’ll be obtaining our “blackout” data.\n\n\nCode\n# === Building mosaics (composites) of spatially disjoint stars objects === #\n\n# combining 1 & 2 for night 1 (Feb. 7th, no blackouts)\nnight_feb_7 &lt;- st_mosaic(night_lights1_star, night_lights2_star)\n\n# and 3 & 4 for night 2 (Feb. 16th, blackouts had occurred)\nnight_feb_16 &lt;- st_mosaic(night_lights3_star, night_lights4_star)\n\n# ==== viewing the outcomes of aggregating our data into the 2 nights ==== #\n\n# night 1 (control/no blackouts)\nplot(night_feb_7)\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# night 2 (blackouts)\nplot(night_feb_16)\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are a few things to note here:\n\nThe second night, February 16th, looks brighter overall. This is likely due to cloud cover and atmospheric activity from the storm acting as “noise”, which makes it difficult to have a perfectly clear image \nThat being said, this is the clearest night out of the storm date range, so we’re going to just have to work with what we’ve got, taking note of this “noise” in our analysis \nThere are methods to account for this, but that is outside of the scope of this project.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, the night lights data is currently in the CRS: EPSG:4326. We will eventually reproject it to EPSG:3083 (NAD83 / Texas Centric Albers Equal Area), but we need to perform a few steps first."

I then vectorize the mask and fix any invalid geometries.\n\n\nCode\n# finding the difference or change in light intensity between the two nights\ndifference &lt;- night_feb_7 - night_feb_16\n\n# ==== create mask ==== #\n# using \"cut\" to convert numeric (drop of more than 200 nW cm^-2^sr^-1 in the second night) to Factor (blackout, NA), using the cutoff range of 200 to infinity\nblackout_diff &lt;- cut(x = difference,\n                         breaks = c(200, Inf), # everything with a difference of more than 200\n                         labels = \"blackout\") # label as experiencing a blackout\n\n# when using \"cut\", \"Values which fall outside the range of breaks are coded as NA, as are NaN and NA values.\" so we've already reclassified the other values as NA. \n\n# this only gives us a list, not a dataframe, so I'll make a dataframe in the next step\n\n\n# vectorizing the blackout mask \nvectorized_mask &lt;- blackout_diff %&gt;% \n  st_as_sf() %&gt;% \n  st_make_valid() # fixing any invalid geometries\n\n# check to see if properly converted it to sf data.frame:\n# cat(\"Class of vectorized mask:\", class(vectorized_mask))\n\n\nNow that the blackout mask is vectorized, I want to move on to crop this mask to our region or area of interest: the Houston metropolitan area. Before I can jump to cropping, I need to define the area of interest, turn those coordinates into a polygon, convert that polygon into a simple feature collection, and project it into the same CRS as the mask.\nI’ll define the Houston metropolitan area with the following coordinates:\n(-96.5, 29), (-96.5, 30.5), (-94.5, 30.5), (-94.5, 29)\n\nThese are written as (xmin, ymin), (xmin, ymax), (xmax, ymax), and (xmax, ymin) – I like to think of this as how a rectangle would be plotted on a graph, and then applying that same logic to a Cartesian plane. I’ll turn these coordinates into a polygon using st_polygon. In the same line, I will convert the polygon into a simple feature collection using st_sfc() and assign a CRS. Because we are using this polygon to crop the night lights data, it needs the same CRS (EPSG:4326). After this step, I’ll convert both the polygon and the cropped mask to EPSG:3083.\n\n\nCode\n# following the structure outlined in Chapter 4 in the GeoComputation with R textbook...\n\n# using cbind to create 2 lists of x and y coordinates, with each of the 4 coordinates for our polygon taken out individually\nhouston_coords = cbind( \n  x = c(-96.5, -96.5, -94.5, -94.5, -96.5), # 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and back to 1st\n  y = c(29, 30.5, 30.5, 29, 29)) # 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and back to 1st to close the polygon\n\n\n# turning the polygon into a polygon and converting that polygon into an sf collection, \n# following the structure outlined in Chapter 4 of the Geocomputation with R textbook\nhouston_polygon = st_sfc(st_polygon(list(houston_coords)), # using the same syntax as the textbook\n                         crs = \"EPSG:4326\") # using the same CRS as the night lights dataset we checked earlier\n\n# check to see if the CRS match before moving on the rest of the question in the following chunk\n# print(paste(\"The CRS of the Houston polygon and our vectorized mask match:\", st_crs(houston_polygon) == st_crs(vectorized_mask)))\n\n\n# assigning new subset name to this cropped view of our nightlights data\nnightlights_cropped &lt;- st_crop(vectorized_mask,\n                               houston_polygon)\n\n\n# reprojecting the mask to EPSG:3083\nnightlights_transformed &lt;- st_transform(nightlights_cropped, # data we're reprojecting\n                                        crs = \"EPSG:3083\") # specifying the CRS\n\n# reprojecting the polygon to EPSG:3083 to use it in cropping and plotting later on\nhouston_polygon_3083 &lt;- st_transform(houston_polygon,\n                                     crs = st_crs(buildings))\n\n# viewing our cropped, transformed data:\n# plot(nightlights_transformed)"

I don’t want to include light coming from traffic on highways in my analysis, so I’ll use the roads data I loaded in previously. When I read in the data, I defined a SQL query to select just the highways (class “motorway”).\nThis highways data will serve as the guide for where to “cut out” areas in the blackout mask that are within 200m of highways. To do this, I first made sure that the data is in the same CRS (essential for geospatial data manipulation), then identify areas within 200 meters of all highways using st_buffer. This step alone will produce undissolved buffers, so I’ll use st_union() in that same step to dissolve them.\n\n\nCode\n# check to see if the crs of our two datasets match (they do, as I reprojected the highways, buildings, and census geometries data to EPSG:3083 when we read in the data initially)\n# cat(\"The CRS match:\", st_crs(highways) == st_crs(nightlights_transformed))\n\n# preliminary plot of highways to explore the data\n# plot(highways$geom, max.plot=1)\n# there are \"6085 observations of 11 variables\"...\n\n# creating a buffer zone 200m around highways\nhighways_buffer &lt;- st_buffer(highways,\n                             dist = 200) %&gt;% # specifying buffer distance, in meters\n                    st_union() # dissolving buffers\n\n# checking to see if this leaves us with just 1 layer\n# plot(highways_buffer)\n# it does!\n# viewing our nightlights data combined with the highways buffer\n# plot(nightlights_transformed, add = TRUE)\n\n\nNow we can use this buffer around the highways to exclude those areas from our blackout mask.\nThe reason I said “cut out” earlier is because I don’t want to preserve the geometries of the polygons that intersect with the highways buffer that I will create. To do this, I will use st_difference(), which will not preserve the geometries. I picture a cookie cutter when I think of this method.\n\n\nCode\n# finding areas that do not intersect with the buffer zone\n \n#thought process: use st_intersect, get binary predicate of T/F values for if polygons share geometries with road buffer zone, select ones that do not...\n\n# we don't necessarily want to preserve the original geometries, so it's okay to cut the nightlights data using our highways buffer as the \"cookie cutter\" \n\n# using st_difference to find all of the polygons in x (nightlights) not including (via cutting) the highways buffer geometries. \nblackout_no_road &lt;- st_difference(x = nightlights_transformed, y = highways_buffer)\n\n# plotting the areas that were \"impacted\" (farther than 200 m away from a road) by blackouts:\n# plot(blackout_no_road)\n\n\nAfter this ‘cookie cutter’ step, I can find the number of areas that experienced blackouts that are farther than 200 meters from a highway. This is what we’ll consider “impacted”, i.e., experienced a blackout, in this analysis.\n\n\nCode\n# displaying the number of polygons included after cutting out our buffered roads mask\ncat(\"There were\", nrow(blackout_no_road), \"areas farther than 200m from a highway that experienced a blackout.\\n\")\n\n\nThere were 7247 areas farther than 200m from a highway that experienced a blackout.\n\n\nCode\n# intuition check: did our previous mask contain the same number of observations?\n#cat(\"\\nDo our pre- and post-highway excluded masks contain the same number of observations?:\", nrow(nightlights_transformed) == nrow(blackout_no_road), \"\\n\")\n\n# showing the number of complete polygons that were eliminated during this cutout\n# diff_lengths &lt;- nrow(nightlights_transformed) - nrow(blackout_no_road)\n\n# cat(\"\\nThere were\", diff_lengths, \"areas within 200 meters of a road that experienced a blackout\")"

Let’s plot the distribution to investigate further:\n\nDistribution of median income by blackout status\nTo further visualize this relationship, I create subsets of impacted and unimpacted tracts and plot the distribution of median income below.\n\n\nCode\n# plot the distribution of income in impacted and un-impacted tracts\n\n# making two separate dataframes, filtering for & NOT for GEOID_Data (census tracts that are or are not impacted by blackouts) \n\n# filtering for census tracts IN HOUSTON that are impacted\nimpacted &lt;- houston_census_income %&gt;%  # using our census + income dataset cropped to the Houston polygon\n  filter(GEOID_Data %in% unique(blackout_census$GEOID_Data)) # keeping rows that have matching values in the list of unique GEOID_Data values from our blackout + census dataset. \n\n# filtering for census tracts in Houston that are NOT impacted\nunimpacted &lt;- houston_census_income %&gt;% \n  filter(!GEOID_Data %in% unique(blackout_census$GEOID_Data)) # selecting rows in the GEOID_Data column in our dataset that are NOT in the list of GEOID_Data values that are in our blackout-filtered dataset.\n\n\n# check: impacted census tracts should be the same number as the value we got before:\n# length(unique(blackout_census$GEOID_Data)) == nrow(impacted)\n# returns\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# mean_impacted_income &lt;- \n# using ggplot() and geom_histogram() to plot the distribution of income in impacted and unimpacted census tracts\nimpacted_plot &lt;- ggplot() +\n  geom_histogram(data = impacted, # using our filtered dataframe from the previous chunk\n                 aes(x = median_income),\n                 fill = \"black\", # fill = black for impacted by blackouts feels intuitive\n                 bins = 30) + # custom number of bins\n  ylim(0, 100) + # setting y limits to have a consistent scale across my plots\n  labs(title = \"Impacted by blackouts\",  # updating title\n       x = \"Median Income\", # and axes labels\n       y = \"Count\") +\n  theme_bw() # customizing theme\n\nunimpacted_plot &lt;- ggplot() +\n  geom_histogram(data = unimpacted, # using our filtered dataframe from the previous chunk\n                 aes(x = median_income),\n                 fill = \"gold\", # gold is more legible than yellow, indicates lack of blackout\n                 bins = 30) +\n  ylim(0, 100) + # setting y limits to have a consistent scale across my plots\n  labs(title = \"Un-impacted by blackouts\", # updating title\n       x = \"Median Income\", # and axes labels\n       y = \"Count\") +\n  theme_bw() # customizing theme\n\n# using patchwork to show the distributions side by side\nimpacted_plot + unimpacted_plot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResults\nBased on these histograms, it is hard to see a notable difference between the distribution of median income per blackout group – impacted vs. un-impacted. This would suggest that residents in Houston were impacted by blackouts during the storm (at least on February 16th, 2021) regardless of the median income per census tract. The videos linked at the top of this analysis along with other reports on the blackout events during the extreme winter storms of early 2021 in Texas suggest that the energy/power infrastructure and distribution practices left the state of Texas unequipped for the extreme demands or loads brought on by the storm. These energy issues, coupled with infrastructure failures related to extreme, cold temperatures in a climate that does not regularly face these temperatures, such as water pipes bursting, caused the impacts of the winter storm to be severe. The dense aggregation of data around the lower median income range in the impacted group may indicate that though homes may have experienced blackouts equally, they would not be impacted equally, as the ability to recover from severe weather events and other impacts of climate change is related to socioeconomic status 3, 4.\n\n\nConclusion & Limitations\nThere are many limitations to this study at different levels. The first notable limitation is the light scaling difference between our “control” night lights data and our “test” or storm-impacted night lights data. In the preliminary images rendered, we can see that the scale of light intensity ranges much higher on the “storm” night, February 16th, 2021. Continuing on with our analysis of this data without adjusting our scales to match between the control and test groups may have led to areas that experienced blackouts being obscured by the overall “noise” or opacity of the brighter lights in that night’s data.\nOur ACS data is also a limitation of this study – it is from 2019, while the blackouts we’re analyzing were in 2021. In three years, a lot can change for individuals financially. Another limitation is that we are looking at residential buildings blackouts, not factoring in the number of “homes” or occupied apartments, for example, within an apartment building. There’s also the factor of how we buffered to remove areas within 200m of highways. This step could have potentially omitted areas with disproportionately lower income households.\nWe’re also not considering or quantifying the cost or burden of recovery from the event, which is where the socioeconomic level data becomes more meaningful. To claim that areas, later quantified as census tracts, which were further classified based on median income, were “impacted” or “un-impacted” based on the originally imperfect night lights data feels incomplete or dissatisfying to me. The weight of the term “impact” carries implications about the level of impact that individuals carry based on this blackout event, such as recovery factors. Lower-income individuals and households would likely be disproportionately impacted by the financial burdens of replacing damage caused by the storm or medical bills from any injuries or health issues related to the storm, for example 5, 6. The scope of this analysis is limited to the a day of clearer night light data (February 16th, 2021), which is temporally limiting as it might not be the height of the blackouts.\nBy not factoring in anything other than visible blackout status and median income of a census tract in these final visualizations (the map and histograms), it feels like we’ve barely scratched the surface of being able to grasp the severity and complexity of how the storms and subsequent blackouts truly impacted the residents of Houston, and the greater state of Texas. A possible next step in our exploration of data relating to the impacts of the blackouts in Houston could be to incorporate data about proximity to different types of energy sources or power distribution infrastructure, or bringing in some quantifiable cost of recovery. It has been almost three years since the event, and I hope to find more meaningful answers and visualize them in the future."
